Hello and welcome to my Unity sandbox project! Originally started as a game jam project in 2023 that got a little hairy with complexity but bore a bunch of excellent systems such as:
Save/Load to JSON
Player & World Inventory System
Basic implementation of an NPC Dialogue System

Now it serves as the staging ground for different modular systems as they're written.

This was inspired by games like Yume Nikki and What Remains of Edith Finch. Meant to be a short collect-a-thon through around 6-7 scenes with unique items, character, interactions in a dream-like environment.
